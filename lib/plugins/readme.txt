This folder holds state machine plug-ins. These allow the
basic state machine description mechanism to be augmented,
allowing for a much richer range of ways of specifying
states.

The defaults directory holds plug-ins that are automatically registered,
the 'others' directory holds plug-ins that have to be explicitly requested.
